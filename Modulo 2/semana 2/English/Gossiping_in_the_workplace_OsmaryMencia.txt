Osmary:
Hey Camilo! How’s it going?

Camilo:
Hey Osmary! I’m okay. But I gotta tell you something about work.

Osmary:
Oh yeah? Tell me, What’s up?

Camilo:
I really like my workplace — it’s beautiful, safe, quiet, and very clean. The office has a relaxed atmosphere. But I don’t like my coworker Mike. He’s rude, lazy, selfish, and really unprofessional.

Osmary:
Rude and lazy? What does he do?

Camilo:
He never helps anyone. He’s loud, disorganized, and always complaining. He talks a lot and does very little work. It’s bad for the team and makes the environment stressful.

Osmary:
That sounds terrible. I don’t like working with irresponsible and negative people. It’s awful and uncomfortable.

Camilo:
I know, right? But what about you? What’s the situation like in your area?

Osmary:
Actually, things are going pretty well in Customer Service! The environment is friendly and positive. People said nice things about our work this week, and the team is motivated, helpful, and very hardworking.

Camilo:
Nice, that’s good to hear. Glad at least one of us is having a good week.

Osmary:
Hang in there, Camilo. Sometimes things get better when you least expect it.

Camilo:
Hope so. Thanks, Osmary. Catch you later!

Osmary:
See ya!
