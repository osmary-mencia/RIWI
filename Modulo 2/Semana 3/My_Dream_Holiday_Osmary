Script: “My Dream Holiday – South Korea”

Hi, everyone!

Today I’m going to talk about my dream holiday.

I want to go to South Korea.
It’s a beautiful country.

I love the fashion, the traditions, and the landscapes.
I like K-pop and Korean dramas too.
I choose South Korea because I enjoy learning about new cultures.
I like how people dress and the way they live.
I prefer going to new and interesting places.


In Korea, I want to:

Wear traditional clothes called hanbok
Visit Seoul, Busan and Jeju Island
Take pictures and walk in the streets
Go to a K-pop concert
Go shopping in markets


I also want to try Korean food like bibimbap, tteokbokki, and Korean BBQ.
But I don’t like spicy food. I prefer sweet or not spicy dishes.


I prefer to stay in a hotel or a guesthouse.
I want to sleep in a Korean-style room with a bed on the floor.


This is my dream vacation because I love Korean culture.
It’s fun, beautiful, and different.

Thank you!
